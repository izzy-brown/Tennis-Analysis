# Tennis-Analysis
I conducted a video performance analysis of Nick Kyrgios vs Rafael Nadal’s 2019 Wimbledon match. Using NacSport and RStudio for visualisation, I explored how return-of-serve placement and tactical adaptability influence match outcomes at the elite level.

Key insights from the analysis:

•	The tactical value of deep return placement in neutralising serve advantage. 

•	The impact of psychological composure on consistency under pressure. 

•	The role of data-driven insights in shaping technical and mental training strategies. 

This project helped me strengthen my skills in:

•	Performance and video analysis. 

•	Data interpretation and visualisation. 

•	Critical reflection. 

'Tennis Analysis' shows my reflective essay, which explores how video and data analysis can enhance performance understanding in elite sport.
