# Tennis-Analysis
I conducted a video performance analysis of Nick Kyrgios vs Rafael Nadal’s 2019 Wimbledon match. Using NacSport and RStudio for visualisation, I explored how return-of-serve placement and tactical adaptability influence match outcomes at the elite level.

Key insights from the analysis:

•	The tactical value of deep return placement in neutralising serve advantage. 

•	The impact of psychological composure on consistency under pressure. 

•	The role of data-driven insights in shaping technical and mental training strategies. 

This project helped me strengthen my skills in:

•	Performance and video analysis. 

•	Data interpretation and visualisation. 

•	Critical reflection. 

Here is the link to the powerpoint analysis.

'Tennis Analysis' shows my reflective essay, which explores how video and data analysis can enhance performance understanding in elite sport.

'VideoAnalysisAssessment1.R' shows my R code used to manipulate and visualise the data I collected from the video.
